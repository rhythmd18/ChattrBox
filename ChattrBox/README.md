## Description: 
ChattrBox is a simple and lightweight conversational AI chatbot which has been built primarily using the Flask as the main backend framework. It uses the PyTorch library which has been used to train the data and the nltk(Natural Language Toolkit) library for Natural Language Processing. It uses a Feet Forward Neural Network with two hidden layers.
For the frontend, technologies used are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with BootStrap for the aesthetics.
It's a very basic chatbot, and so conversations that accurately replicate a real world conversation is not to be expected. Nonetheless, it should still be pretty enjoyable!
